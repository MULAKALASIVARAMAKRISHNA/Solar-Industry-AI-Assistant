# Solar Industry AI Assistant - Submission

## **1. Project Overview**

The **Solar Industry AI Assistant** is designed to provide accurate, insightful, and easy-to-understand information about solar energy to both technical and non-technical users. The assistant integrates **LLMs** with a structured knowledge base to ensure reliable responses.

## **2. Implementation Details**

### **AI Implementation (40%)**

- **LLM Integration:** Utilized OpenRouter API for conversational responses.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Tailored prompts to extract relevant solar industry insights.
- **Context Management:** Implemented session-based memory to maintain user interaction coherence.
- **Response Accuracy:** Verified responses with a curated dataset of solar industry knowledge.

### **Development (40%)**

- **Backend API Development:** Created a REST API using **FastAPI** to handle AI queries.
- **Web Interface Creation:** Developed an interactive interface using **Streamlit**.
- **Code Quality:** Followed clean coding principles and modular architecture.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive inline comments and external documentation.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust exception handling to prevent failures.

## **3. Project Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites:**

## **4. Example Use Cases**

- **User:** "How do solar panels work?"

  - **AI Response:** "Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells, which generate direct current (DC) that is then converted to alternating current (AC) for home or commercial use."

- **User:** "What is the typical ROI for solar installations?"

  - **AI Response:** "The return on investment (ROI) for solar installations depends on factors such as location, incentives, and energy usage. On average, ROI ranges between 5-10 years."

## **5. Future Improvements**

- **Enhancing LLM capabilities** with fine-tuned domain-specific training.
- **Expanding dataset** for more precise solar energy insights.
- **Integration with real-time data sources** for updated market trends.
- **Deployment to cloud platforms** for global accessibility.
